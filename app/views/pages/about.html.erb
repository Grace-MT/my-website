<h1>A little bit about me💫</h1>

    <div class="card-container">
    <p>📈I left my career in Investment Management which I had been working on for the past nine years this year - super scary times 👻.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
    <p>➕It wasn't that I didn't like it, I actually think understanding how financial markets and money in general works has set me up for a life of being able to manage my own finances very effectively and think we need to get into school and teach financial education way more than we do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
    <p>⚠️I actually ended up in finance by complete accident. I am from quite a small place and always knew I wanted a really cool career, but wasn't quite sure what. I couldn't even visualise it.
    When I moved to London I went with what I thought my best skill was at the time which was 'organising things' and became a PA at a small Investment Management Firm.
    Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, my self esteem was on the floor and I didn't think I was 'clever enough' to be any more than a PA for someone else. (I know, get your violins out 🎻).
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>🍀Luckily, I worked with some very clever but also very kind people at the Investment Management Firm, who helped me build up my confidence and encouraged me when I put my hand up to say I wanted to progress and sit the necessary exams to be able to get more involved in the business.
      I remember several times when I asked to sit the exams or when a more developed role became available thinking everyone was going to laugh at me when I said I wanted to do it. Sadly, I didn't think I was good enough.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>🧠However I am now SO glad I did these big scary things as it turned out not being good enough was all in my head. I worked super hard to teach myself University Level Maths and Economics to pass my exams, I found it super hard as I had never been 'good' at Maths in school.
        I failed the exam a couple of times and was devastated, but third time lucky I passed! The confidence I gained from doing something that felt almost impossible made me realise I could do anything I put my mind to and from then on there has been no stopping me 🚀</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>💻During my time in Investment Management, I worked on many projects where I collaborated with Web Developers on Digital Marketing, Digital Strategy, CRM Projects and so on.
      There was one time in particular when an error kept occouring and the company we were working with were taking way too long to fix bugs and I was impatient, I had deadlines to hit!
      So I went into the code with no prior experience and figured out how to fix the issue myself. This was in 2018 way before ChatGPT! I remember the feeling of fixing the code was so satisfying and I think this is where a seed was planted that maybe I liked this clever coding stuff 🌱.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>🦇Then 2020 hit and we all get locked down (will we ever find out if it had anything to do with bats?)😷<p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>🌴I was extremely lucky and managed to get stuck in Bali for lockdown in 2020. I was on holiday and had taken my laptop just incase.
        It maybe was the smartest move I ever made as it meant I worked from Bali without interruption all through 2020.
        Before COVID, I hadn't thought of work being possible from anywhere other than my desk in London. Now working in Bali from home or in coffee shops meeting other remote workers opened Pandora's box to me, it was so liberating to know I could work efectively from anywhere 🔓.
        <p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>🆒I met some super cool people during this time and in particular made a friend who was studying Web Development with Le Wagon at their Bali campus (the plot thickens).<p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>✈️When the pandemic calmed down and flights started leaving Bali, I headed back to London. It was a very strange experience to pack your bags and say goodbye to your friends and family to go on a yoga holiday and then get stuck on a dreamy island and end up staying for six months meanwhile the whole world had completely changed forever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>💼I continued work hard at my job and progressed into Sales and Business Development in Investment Management, eventually leading the firm's efforts in the UK Wealth Sector.
      I was enjoying myself, but I always had this niggle about my friend who did the coding bootcamp. It sounded super cool and I guess that seed that had been planted back in 2018 had been growing and maybe to extend the metaphor, all of the new things I was learning, the new people I was meeting and content I was consuming where watering this culmination of self belief and curiosity 🪴.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>💥Then BOOM. Cutting a long story short 2024 came around and I took the leap, quit my job and enrolled on Le Wagon London's Intensive Web Development Bootcamp. The bootcamp certainly lived up to it's name, I personally found it brutal in the best way possible, such a challenge.
        I graudated on 31st May 2024 and still can't believe I did it. Younger Grace would never have had the courage or self belief to do these things. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>🤍What I think this story shows is that with a mixture of some kindness from others, belief in yourself and for me (not for everyone) a solid yoga/breathe practise can be like getting the cheat codes for life and you can do anything you set your mind to.
      I am just SO grateful to all the people I've met and opportunities that I have had so far that brought me to this point.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-container">
      <p>❓So what's next? For me, I'd just LOVE to get involved in supporting, building or designing tech products in ANY capacity. I'm currently looking for my first role and so acutely aware I need to start at the bottom and graft my way up which I am so excited to do.
        So please get in touch if you are looking for an extremely tenacious yet gracious addition to your team 🙋🏻‍♀️.</p>
